# The Holy Trinity + 1

A reusable documentation system for AI-assisted coding projects: three documents that
answer *what*, *how*, and *now* — the "holy trinity" — plus the constitution that
governs them. A fifth, optional document (the runbook) carries operational procedure
once a project has a real deployment.

Copy the templates in this folder into a new project's `docs/` folder, fill in the
placeholders, and delete what doesn't apply.

## The five documents

| Document | Question it answers | Authority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`CONSTITUTION.md`](CONSTITUTION.md) | How must this project be built? | Permanent rules |
| [`BRIEF.md`](BRIEF.md) | What are we building and why? | Product truth |
| [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md) | How are we going to build it? | Execution truth |
| [`LOG.md`](LOG.md) | What is actually happening now? | Operational memory |
| [`RUNBOOK.md`](RUNBOOK.md) | How do we release, activate, and recover it? | Operational procedure |
| Code + tests + Git | What actually exists? | **Machine truth** |

That last row is the one rule everything else defers to. The documents *control* the
work — they tell an agent what to build next and what "done" means — but they must
never be allowed to override what the repository, the tests, and Git history actually
demonstrate. When a document and the code disagree, the code is right.

## Why four documents and not one giant instruction file

A single sprawling `AGENTS.md`-style file becomes counterproductive at scale: it
consumes context, goes stale, and makes everything look equally important. Splitting
by *question* rather than by *topic* keeps each document short, keeps it obviously
current or obviously stale, and lets a session load only the one it needs.

The split also creates a control property large instruction files don't have:
**a bug can't be "fixed" by quietly rewriting the requirement.** BRIEF.md defines what
must be true; PLAN.md defines how; LOG.md records whether it actually is. As long as
those stay separate, a coding agent can't paper over a failing acceptance test by
loosening the acceptance criteria in the same breath — the two facts live in different
files with different owners.

### Make each document sharp, not vague

- **BRIEF.md** is only useful if its must-haves are testable. "Users can log in" gives
  an agent nothing to check against. "An invalid credential returns an error without
  revealing whether the account exists" does. Convert every must-have into acceptance
  criteria before implementation starts — and write down what's explicitly **out of
  scope**, because models embellish, and the brief is the only place that says no.
- **PLAN.md** is not just an architecture description — it's the executable work
  queue. A task without a stopping condition ("done when these acceptance criteria
  pass") invites an agent to keep "improving" it indefinitely. Plan the architecture
  broadly; plan only the next few tasks precisely, and re-plan the next slice once the
  current one lands rather than trying to predict the whole project up front.
- **LOG.md** is what makes a fresh agent session productive after 30 seconds of
  reading, instead of re-deriving state from scratch. Keep it operational and mostly
  append-only: replace stale facts with current ones, don't narrate the journey. Git
  already has the detailed history — LOG.md carries the *semantic* summary that Git
  can't: what's actually verified, what's blocking, what's next.

## Document authority is asymmetric — on purpose

Don't let an agent freely edit all four documents. If it can, a hard requirement gets
"solved" by editing the requirement instead of the code, and nobody notices until
production.

- **CONSTITUTION.md** — human-controlled. An agent may propose a change; it never
  applies one unasked.
- **BRIEF.md** — human-approved. An agent may flag a product ambiguity it discovers
  during implementation, but doesn't merge the resolution itself.
- **PLAN.md** — human + agent, collaboratively. This is the normal working surface
  during implementation.
- **LOG.md** — mostly agent-maintained, append-only.

## The missing piece most doc systems skip: verification

The natural workflow is *intent → implementation → memory*. That's missing a step. It
needs to be *intent → implementation → verification → memory* — otherwise "the agent
says it's done" is the only signal anyone has, and that signal is exactly the one that
fails silently.

You don't need a sixth document for this. Verification lives in tests, CI, and
PLAN.md's verification matrix; LOG.md just records the results. A working session loop
looks like:

1. Read CONSTITUTION.md, BRIEF.md, PLAN.md, LOG.md, and recent Git state.
2. Confirm the app currently works before changing it.
3. Pick one bounded item from PLAN.md's work queue.
4. Implement it.
5. Run the deterministic gate: build, lint, types, tests.
6. Compare the result against BRIEF.md's acceptance criteria directly — not against a
   vague sense of "should work now."
7. Review the diff for anything unintended.
8. Commit.
9. Update PLAN.md's status and append the result to LOG.md.
10. Only start the next item if the tree is clean.

## The completion trap, and how to close it

The agent that builds a feature is not a reliable judge of whether the feature is
finished — it's the same model that just convinced itself the current implementation
was the right one. Don't ask "have we finished everything?" Ask instead:

> Assume the implementation is incomplete. Compare each acceptance criterion in
> BRIEF.md against the repository and provide evidence that it's satisfied. Any
> criterion without evidence is incomplete.

Run that as a separate pass after a milestone, before declaring it done:

```
BRIEF → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → TEST → AUDIT (brief vs. code)
                                     │
                          gap found ─┴─ no gap
                                │           │
                     add PLAN item     milestone complete
```

Gaps become new PLAN.md items and the cycle repeats until none turn up.

## Two risk modes, same documents

A local prototype with no real users can move fast and loose — genuine "vibe coding"
is fine there. The moment real users, real data, payments, or credentials are
involved, the operating mode has to change: unrestricted agent permissions,
unreviewed AI-authored tests, and out-of-scope edits stop being cheap mistakes and
start being incidents.

Record which mode a project — or a specific surface within it — is in, in
CONSTITUTION.md, and let that decide how much latitude an agent gets: fast
experimentation in vibe mode; mandatory acceptance criteria, tests, security review,
and full diff review in engineering mode. Same documents, same agent, different risk
budget.

## What to call this

Not just "vibe coding." Once tests, acceptance criteria, and a completion audit are
part of the loop, a more accurate name is **spec-guided agentic development** —
or, less formally, **structured vibecoding**:

- Humans own intent and judgment.
- Agents own implementation throughput.
- Tests own verification.
- Git owns history.
- These documents keep all four aligned with each other.

## Using this folder

1. Copy `CONSTITUTION.md`, `BRIEF.md`, `PLAN.md`, `LOG.md`, and — once there's a real
   deployment — `RUNBOOK.md` into the new project's `docs/`.
2. Fill in Law IV/V of `CONSTITUTION.md` with this project's actual non-negotiables,
   then treat the rest of the constitution as done — it's the same governance
   structure for every project.
3. Write `BRIEF.md` first, with testable acceptance criteria and an explicit
   out-of-scope list.
4. Let `PLAN.md`'s work queue grow one bounded slice at a time, not all at once.
5. Keep `LOG.md` current every session — it's the only reason a fresh session isn't
   starting from zero.
