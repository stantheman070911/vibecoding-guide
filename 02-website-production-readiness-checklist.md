# Part 2: Website Production Readiness Checklist

A consolidated checklist for shipping a "vibecoded" website — one built quickly, often with heavy AI assistance — to production. Overlapping items (favicon, 404 handling, titles, meta descriptions, `robots.txt`, alt text, mobile overflow, etc.) have been merged so each point appears once.

## 1. Domain, Branding & Basic Production Polish

* Connect a custom domain instead of only using `*.vercel.app`  
* Add a favicon  
* Replace default "Vite", "React", "Next.js" browser titles  
* Give every important page a unique page title  
* Add a real logo, and make it clickable back to the homepage  
* Fix the copyright year  
* Remove placeholder text and unused navigation items  
* Replace generic stock imagery with real business/team photography where appropriate

## 2. Mobile & Responsive Design

* Make every page mobile-optimized; remove horizontal scrolling and fix overflow  
* Add a proper mobile navigation menu  
* Check tap targets, typography, and image containment at small screen sizes  
* Check tables, cards, and forms on mobile  
* Add a sticky mobile CTA where appropriate  
* Test common widths: 320px, 375px, 390px, 430px, tablet, and desktop

A website is not production-ready if the desktop version works but the mobile version merely "shrinks."

## 3. Navigation & Broken Interactions

* Find and repair broken links, buttons, and footer links  
* Make phone numbers clickable with `tel:` and email addresses with `mailto:`  
* Check all navigation links, CTA destinations, external links, and anchor links  
* Remove dead navigation items  
* Confirm browser Back/Forward navigation works correctly

## 4. Error Handling & User Feedback

* Add a custom, useful 404 page — not merely decorative  
* Add success and error messages after forms/actions, and visible loading states  
* Prevent buttons from appearing unresponsive during requests  
* Handle failed API requests, empty states, and expired/invalid URLs gracefully  
* Remove raw framework/server errors from the user-facing UI

## 5. Forms & Lead Generation

* Add clear, obvious calls-to-action above the fold  
* Add a thank-you page and confirmation/success state after form submission  
* Add useful validation messages; avoid asking for unnecessary information  
* Test all contact forms end-to-end and verify inquiries reach their destination  
* Add a response-time promise where commercially appropriate (e.g. *"We typically respond within one business day"* — this reduces uncertainty and can materially improve conversion)  
* Track form submissions as conversions

## 6. SEO Fundamentals

* Unique `<title>` and meta description for every important page  
* Add canonical tags, `robots.txt`, and `sitemap.xml`  
* Ensure important pages are indexable; confirm `noindex` isn't accidentally enabled  
* Add internal links and breadcrumbs where appropriate; use descriptive URLs  
* Avoid duplicate pages/content  
* Redirect HTTP → HTTPS and duplicate hostname versions consistently  
* Configure proper 301 redirects when URLs change

## 7. HTML Structure & Semantic SEO

* One meaningful `<h1>` per important page — avoid competing `<h1>` headings  
* Use a logical `h1 → h2 → h3` hierarchy  
* Add a `lang` attribute to `<html>`  
* Use semantic elements (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `footer`) instead of building everything from generic `<div>`s

The goal is a coherent document hierarchy, not simply satisfying an SEO checker.

## 8. Image SEO & Accessibility

* Add useful alt text to meaningful images; use empty alt text for decorative ones  
* Avoid keyword-stuffed alt text  
* Compress images, serve appropriately sized versions, and prefer modern formats  
* Lazy-load below-the-fold images  
* Set image width/height to reduce layout shift

## 9. Social Sharing

* Add Open Graph metadata: title, description, canonical/share URL, and a share image  
* Add Twitter/X card metadata where relevant  
* Test how links actually look when shared

You do not want "Vite \+ React", a localhost-style title, no image, and a random description appearing when someone shares your business.

## 10. Structured Data / Schema

* Add relevant Schema.org structured data (LocalBusiness, Organization, Breadcrumb, FAQ where applicable and consistent with visible content)  
* Add contact/business information correctly and validate the structured data  
* Keep schema consistent with what users can actually see

## 11. Local Business Websites

For plumbers, contractors, dentists, restaurants, agencies, clinics, etc.:

* Add business address, clickable phone number, hours, map, and directions  
* Add LocalBusiness schema and service-area information  
* Add real customer reviews, testimonials, and project/customer photography  
* Add location/service pages where genuinely useful  
* Keep NAP information (Name, Address, Phone) consistent everywhere it appears

## 12. Trust & Conversion

* Clear CTA and value proposition above the fold; explain who the product/service is for  
* Add real customer reviews and testimonials with attribution, plus a case-study section  
* Add roughly five useful FAQs and response-time expectations  
* Add real team/company photography and contact information  
* Add a privacy policy and terms where appropriate  
* Add trust indicators only when genuine — avoid fabricated logos, reviews, or testimonials

## 13. Content Quality

* Remove AI placeholder copy, "Lorem ipsum," and generic claims like "We provide innovative solutions"  
* Remove duplicated sections; check spelling and grammar; verify all factual claims  
* Make CTAs specific and explain services/products clearly  
* Make homepage messaging understandable within several seconds  
* Ensure every page has a clear purpose

A common vibecoding failure is a technically functional website containing copy that says almost nothing.

## 14. Crawlability & Rendering

* Check what appears in View Source, and confirm crawlers can reach critical content  
* Avoid unnecessarily making the entire site client-rendered  
* Verify page metadata is server-rendered where appropriate  
* Check pages with JavaScript disabled/degraded if SEO matters  
* Check robots directives, and decide intentionally whether AI crawlers should be allowed or blocked

An empty-looking View Source is a warning sign, not automatically a bug. For an app or dashboard, heavy client rendering can be reasonable; for SEO landing pages, it deserves investigation.

## 15. Analytics & Measurement

* Install analytics (Google Analytics, PostHog, or another intentional stack) and verify it fires in production  
* Track major CTA clicks, form submissions, and conversions (signup, purchase/subscription completion, etc.)  
* Exclude internal/test traffic where useful  
* Avoid collecting unnecessary personal information

## 16. Performance

* Compress images; remove enormous JS bundles and unused dependencies  
* Code-split and lazy-load expensive components; avoid shipping server libraries to the client  
* Audit third-party scripts and optimize fonts  
* Avoid layout shifts; check Largest Contentful Paint, Interaction to Next Paint, and Cumulative Layout Shift  
* Test on a slower mobile connection and lower-end hardware

Vibecoded sites frequently perform well on the developer's MacBook and poorly on an actual customer's phone.

## 17. Browser Console & Production Hygiene

* Production console should not be full of errors — fix failed network requests, framework warnings, and hydration errors  
* Remove debug logging, development banners, and unused code/assets  
* Disable debug mode and check production environment configuration  
* Decide intentionally whether production source maps should be exposed  
* Verify production builds rather than relying solely on local dev mode

## 18. Secrets & API Keys

**Critical, not optional polish.**

* Hide API keys; never put secret keys in frontend JavaScript  
* Audit environment variables and distinguish public vs. private ones  
* Check Git history (including old branches/tags) for accidentally committed secrets, and rotate anything exposed  
* Restrict API keys where the provider supports it; use separate dev/production credentials  
* Ensure `.env` files are not committed, and verify build logs don't expose secrets

One of the highest-risk vibecoding mistakes is asking an AI to integrate an API and then accidentally shipping the secret into the client bundle.

*See [Part 3](03-security-remediation-playbook.md#secrets--keys) for detailed remediation steps on hard-coded credentials and exposed client-side keys.*

## 19. Authentication & Authorization

* Add authentication when private functionality exists; protect admin routes and APIs  
* Verify authentication and check permissions server-side  
* Implement authorization separately from authentication; prevent users from requesting another user's data  
* Test unauthenticated requests and low-privilege users attempting admin actions manually

**Critical principle:** a button hidden from the user does not mean permission denied. The server/database must enforce authorization.

*See [Part 3](03-security-remediation-playbook.md#authentication--authorization) for detailed remediation steps on client-side auth, IDOR, broken access controls, session handling, and auth bypass paths.*

## 20. Database Security

* Check database access rules; enable Row Level Security where applicable  
* Test database policies and prevent direct unauthorized writes  
* Parameterize database queries and apply least-privilege access  
* Never expose service/admin database credentials to browsers  
* Back up important data and verify destructive operations require appropriate authorization

For Supabase in particular, a very common vibecoding mistake is building the UI first, discovering permissions later, then leaving tables overly permissive so the app "works."

## 21. Input & Application Security

* Sanitize and validate user input — on the server, not only the client  
* Protect against XSS, SQL injection, and unsafe URL redirects  
* Validate IDs and object ownership; reject unexpected input and limit payload sizes  
* Avoid blindly rendering AI- or user-generated HTML; escape output appropriately

*See [Part 3](03-security-remediation-playbook.md#injection-vulnerabilities) for detailed remediation steps on SQL injection, XSS, and command injection.*

## 22. Abuse Prevention & Cost Protection

Particularly important for AI products.

* Add rate limiting, especially on authentication endpoints, expensive APIs, and AI generation endpoints  
* Protect contact forms from spam and add reasonable request-size limits  
* Add provider billing/spend alerts and spend caps where supported  
* Add per-user usage quotas where appropriate to prevent unlimited expensive jobs

An AI endpoint without rate limiting can turn a $20/month infrastructure bill into a $2,000 surprise bill very quickly.

*See [Part 3, item 16](03-security-remediation-playbook.md#security-headers--protections) for a detailed remediation plan.*

## 23. File Upload Security

* Require authentication where appropriate; restrict file types and verify MIME types  
* Limit maximum file size and generate server-side filenames rather than trusting user filenames  
* Prevent executable uploads where inappropriate; restrict storage permissions  
* Prevent users from accessing private uploads belonging to others; avoid exposing private storage buckets accidentally  
* Consider malware scanning for higher-risk systems

## 24. Web Security Configuration

* Enable HTTPS and redirect HTTP to HTTPS  
* Add appropriate security headers: CSP, HSTS, MIME-sniffing and framing protections  
* Secure cookies with `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and an appropriate `SameSite` policy  
* Check CORS configuration; avoid `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` for sensitive APIs  
* Add CSRF protection where the authentication architecture requires it

*See [Part 3](03-security-remediation-playbook.md#security-headers--protections) for detailed remediation steps on security headers and CSRF.*

## 25. Deployment & Production Configuration

* Check all production environment variables and staging vs. production configuration  
* Disable debug mode and development-only endpoints  
* Check production API URLs, OAuth redirect URLs, webhook URLs, and allowed origins  
* Verify email is using the production domain, and that the payment system is in the correct mode  
* Verify the database points to production, and that backups, monitoring, and error tracking are in place  
* Test deployment from a clean build

## The higher-level audit

The checklist above reduces to eight production gates:

| Gate | Question |
| ----- | ----- |
| 1\. Does it work? | Links, buttons, forms, routing, 404, errors |
| 2\. Does it work on mobile? | Responsive design, overflow, menus, tap targets |
| 3\. Can people find it? | SEO, metadata, sitemap, robots, schema |
| 4\. Does it convert? | CTAs, reviews, FAQs, case studies, forms |
| 5\. Does it look legitimate? | Domain, favicon, branding, real content/photos |
| 6\. Is it fast? | Images, JS bundles, rendering, Core Web Vitals |
| 7\. Can we measure it? | Analytics, conversions, error monitoring |
| 8\. Can it be attacked? | Secrets, auth, authorization, input, DB, uploads, abuse |

The last gate deserves the most weight in the AI/vibecoding era: bad metadata makes a site look amateur, but bad authorization can expose an entire customer database.

Treat the checklist across three severity levels:

* **P0 — Security / data / money:** exposed API keys, auth, permissions, database rules, uploads, rate limiting, payment configuration, production settings.  
* **P1 — Functionality / conversion:** broken links, forms, buttons, mobile, errors, CTAs, 404s.  
* **P2 — Discoverability / polish:** SEO, schema, favicon, OG images, titles, metadata, case studies, FAQs.

P0 items correspond to the 🚨 Critical / 🔴 High entries in [Part 3](03-security-remediation-playbook.md).
