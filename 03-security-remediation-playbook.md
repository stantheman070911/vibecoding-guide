# Part 3: Security Remediation Playbook

Detailed, actionable guidance for the highest-risk items in [Part 2](02-website-production-readiness-checklist.md)'s checklist. Each entry lists the risk, the fix approach, and a verification checklist.

Severity legend: 🚨 Critical (fix before shipping) · 🔴 High (fix soon after) · 🟠 Medium (schedule it). These map onto Part 2's P0/P1/P2 scale — 🚨 and 🔴 items here are P0.

## Authentication & Authorization

### 1. Client-Side Authentication — 🚨 Critical

If the login check runs in browser JavaScript, any user can read the source and bypass it. Authentication logic belongs on the server; the client should receive only a session token after the server verifies credentials.

**Fix:**

* Audit the codebase for auth/authorization logic running client-side (password comparisons, role checks, token validation)
* Move all credential validation and role decisions to server-side endpoints
* Client submits credentials only, and receives a verified session token (JWT or secure cookie) in return

**Checklist:**

* \[ \] No password comparisons in frontend JS
* \[ \] No role/permission checks in browser code
* \[ \] Auth logic moved to server/backend

### 2. Missing Authorization Checks (IDOR) — 🚨 Critical

Being logged in doesn't mean access to everything. Every endpoint that returns data must verify the requester owns or is permitted to access that specific resource.

**Fix:**

* Audit every endpoint accepting an identifier (`userId`, `documentId`, `orderId`, etc.) for a server-side ownership/role check
* Never assume authentication implies authorization
* Reject unauthorized access with `403`; scope all ID-based queries to the authenticated user

**Checklist:**

* \[ \] Every resource endpoint checks ownership
* \[ \] IDs are not guessable/sequential without access control
* \[ \] Server validates the user–resource relationship on every request

### 3. Broken Access Controls — 🚨 Critical

Authenticated users should only be able to modify or delete resources they own. Without this, any logged-in attacker can corrupt another user's data.

**Fix:**

* Audit all write/update/delete routes (`POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE`) for explicit server-side ownership checks
* Enforce `resource.ownerId === user.id`, plus role-based checks for admin actions
* Reject unauthorized operations with `403`

**Checklist:**

* \[ \] Delete/edit operations validate ownership server-side
* \[ \] Admin-only routes are protected by role checks
* \[ \] No resource can be modified by an unauthorized user

### 4. Weak Session Handling — 🔴 High

Sessions must be cryptographically secure, expire properly, and be invalidated on logout.

**Fix:**

* Verify session tokens use a cryptographically secure random source with sufficient entropy
* Configure idle and absolute expiration; destroy sessions server-side on logout
* Enforce HTTPS-only transmission with `Secure`/`HttpOnly`/`SameSite` cookies; regenerate session IDs after login or privilege changes

**Checklist:**

* \[ \] Sessions use cryptographically random tokens
* \[ \] Session expiry is configured
* \[ \] Logout invalidates the session server-side
* \[ \] Tokens transmitted only over HTTPS

### 5. Authentication Bypass Paths — 🚨 Critical

Routes that skip authentication entirely — often created by accident — let anyone reach protected functionality without logging in.

**Fix:**

* Build a full route inventory and flag routes that should require auth but don't
* Test for bypass vectors: path manipulation, encoded variants, case-sensitivity gaps, middleware misconfiguration
* Apply consistent auth middleware to every protected route; normalize paths before authorization checks

**Checklist:**

* \[ \] Every protected route has auth middleware applied
* \[ \] No accidental public routes to private resources
* \[ \] Auth middleware cannot be bypassed via URL tricks

## Secrets & Keys

### 6. Hard-Coded Credentials — 🚨 Critical

Passwords, database connection strings, and secrets embedded in source code get committed to git and leaked permanently.

**Fix:**

* Scan source, config files, and committed files for credentials, API keys, and high-entropy tokens
* Migrate all secrets to environment variables; rotate anything already exposed
* Add sensitive files to `.gitignore` and generate a `.env.example` with placeholder values

**Checklist:**

* \[ \] No passwords in source code
* \[ \] No connection strings with credentials in code
* \[ \] All secrets loaded from environment variables
* \[ \] `.env` is in `.gitignore`

### 7. Exposed API Keys in Client-Side Code — 🚨 Critical

Any key shipped in the frontend bundle is public — anyone can open DevTools and take it.

**Fix:**

* Scan frontend code for embedded third-party keys (OpenAI, AWS, Stripe, SendGrid, Firebase, etc.)
* Move the secret server-side and add a backend proxy endpoint that calls the external API and returns only what the client needs
* Apply auth/rate limiting on the proxy and filter sensitive fields from the response

**Checklist:**

* \[ \] No API keys in frontend JS or React code
* \[ \] External API calls proxied through backend
* \[ \] Keys only in server-side environment variables

## Injection Vulnerabilities

### 8. SQL Injection (SQLi) — 🚨 Critical

Concatenating user input into SQL queries lets attackers read, modify, or delete the entire database.

**Fix:**

* Audit every query for string concatenation or interpolation of user input
* Replace with parameterized queries/prepared statements, or the ORM's safe query builder
* Apply input validation and least-privilege database accounts

**Checklist:**

* \[ \] All queries use parameterized statements or ORM-safe methods
* \[ \] No string concatenation with user input in SQL
* \[ \] Database user has minimal required permissions

### 9. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) — 🔴 High

Rendering unescaped user input in HTML lets attackers inject scripts that steal cookies, hijack sessions, or deface the app.

**Fix:**

* Scan for `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, direct `innerHTML` assignment, `document.write`, or string-built HTML using user input
* Replace with safe rendering (JSX binding, `textContent`) or sanitize with a trusted library (e.g., DOMPurify) when raw HTML is unavoidable
* Add a production Content Security Policy, minimizing `unsafe-inline`/`unsafe-eval`

**Checklist:**

* \[ \] No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with unsanitized input
* \[ \] No `innerHTML` with user data
* \[ \] Server-rendered content is escaped
* \[ \] CSP headers configured

### 10. Command Injection — 🚨 Critical

Passing user input to shell commands lets attackers run arbitrary code on the server.

**Fix:**

* Scan for `exec`, `system`, `spawn`, `subprocess`, `os.system`, `popen` calls and trace whether user input reaches them
* Where shell execution is necessary, use array-based arguments (not interpolated strings) and disable shell interpretation
* Where it isn't necessary, replace with a native/library alternative that avoids the shell entirely

**Checklist:**

* \[ \] No user input passed to shell/exec functions
* \[ \] Child processes use argument arrays, not string interpolation
* \[ \] Shell calls replaced with native library alternatives where possible

## Data Storage & Handling

### 11. Insecure Client-Side Storage — 🔴 High

`localStorage` and `sessionStorage` are readable by any JavaScript on the page, including injected scripts — sensitive tokens don't belong there.

**Fix:**

* Scan for `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` usage and classify what's stored (JWTs, session IDs, PII)
* Move auth/session handling to `httpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite` cookies set by the server
* Add CSRF protection to match the cookie-based auth flow

**Checklist:**

* \[ \] JWT tokens not stored in `localStorage`
* \[ \] Sensitive data not in `sessionStorage`
* \[ \] Auth tokens use `httpOnly`, `Secure` cookies

### 12. Weak Password Storage — 🚨 Critical

Plain-text passwords or MD5/SHA-1 hashes are trivially cracked. Use bcrypt, Argon2, or scrypt.

**Fix:**

* Audit the registration/login flow for the hashing method in use
* Replace with bcrypt (cost ≥ 12\) or Argon2id, using the library's built-in salting and constant-time comparison
* Add a transparent migration: re-hash with the new algorithm on next successful login for legacy users

**Checklist:**

* \[ \] Passwords hashed with bcrypt (≥12 rounds) or Argon2
* \[ \] No plain text passwords in database
* \[ \] No MD5/SHA-1 password hashing

### 13. Sensitive Data in URLs and Logs — 🟠 Medium

Tokens or passwords in URLs end up in browser history and server/CDN logs; credentials in log statements persist for months.

**Fix:**

* Check for auth tokens, API keys, or PII passed via query strings or URL paths
* Move sensitive data to POST bodies or headers instead of URLs
* Sanitize logs: avoid dumping full request/response objects, redact credential fields, and keep debug logging out of production

**Checklist:**

* \[ \] No tokens or passwords in URL query strings
* \[ \] Log statements sanitize sensitive fields
* \[ \] Error messages don't expose stack traces or internal data to users

## Security Headers & Protections

### 14. Missing Security Headers — 🟠 Medium

HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, and a few others take under an hour to add and close a meaningful number of attack vectors. Most vibe-coded apps ship without any of them.

**Fix:**

* Add HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, and Permissions-Policy globally via middleware
* Write a strict, app-specific CSP (`default-src 'self'`, explicit `script-src`/`style-src`/`img-src`/`connect-src`/`font-src`, no `unsafe-inline`/`unsafe-eval` unless unavoidable)
* Enforce (not report-only) once verified not to break functionality

**Checklist:**

* \[ \] HSTS header configured
* \[ \] CSP header configured
* \[ \] X-Frame-Options set
* \[ \] X-Content-Type-Options set
* \[ \] Referrer-Policy set

### 15. No CSRF Protection — 🔴 High

Without CSRF protection, a malicious website can trigger authenticated requests to the app on a logged-in user's behalf.

**Fix:**

* Add a framework-appropriate CSRF library (`csurf`, Django's `CsrfViewMiddleware`, Flask-WTF, Spring Security CSRF) to all `POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` routes
* Inject tokens into server-rendered forms; send via header for AJAX/fetch requests
* Set `SameSite=Strict`/`Lax` and `Secure` on session cookies; reject requests with missing/invalid tokens (`403`)

**Checklist:**

* \[ \] CSRF tokens on all state-changing forms
* \[ \] CSRF tokens validated server-side
* \[ \] `SameSite=Strict` or `Lax` on session cookies

### 16. Missing Rate Limiting — 🔴 High

Without rate limiting, attackers can brute-force passwords, enumerate users, or abuse the API indefinitely.

**Fix:**

* Add a rate-limiting library backed by a shared store (e.g., Redis) so limits hold across instances
* Tighten limits on auth (\~5/15 min), password reset (\~3–5/hour), and registration endpoints; apply a baseline limit to public APIs
* Return `429` with a `Retry-After` header; key limits by IP and, where relevant, by account

**Checklist:**

* \[ \] Login endpoint rate limited
* \[ \] Password reset rate limited
* \[ \] Public API endpoints rate limited
* \[ \] Proper 429 responses returned

## Dependencies & Supply Chain

### 17. Hallucinated Packages — 🔴 High

AI models sometimes suggest package names that don't exist. Attackers register those names with malicious code, and the install picks it up.

**Fix:**

* Verify every dependency in the manifest exists on the official registry under the exact expected name
* Check maintainer legitimacy, release activity, and download counts for anything unfamiliar
* Flag typosquatting risks and low-usage packages for manual review before they ship

**Checklist:**

* \[ \] All packages verified on official registries
* \[ \] Package names double-checked for typosquatting
* \[ \] No AI-suggested packages installed without verification

### 18. Outdated Libraries with Known CVEs — 🔴 High

Outdated dependencies are the most common entry point for real-world attacks.

**Fix:**

* Run the stack's audit tool (`npm audit`, `pip-audit`, `cargo audit`, `govulncheck`) and triage by severity
* Upgrade critical/high findings first; note breaking changes that need migration
* Turn on automated dependency alerts (Dependabot or Renovate) so this doesn't silently drift again

**Checklist:**

* \[ \] `npm audit` / `pip-audit` run with no critical/high CVEs
* \[ \] Automated dependency update alerts configured
* \[ \] Lock files committed and up to date

### 19. Insecure Deserialization — 🔴 High

Deserializing untrusted data (especially Python pickle, Java serialization) can execute arbitrary code.

**Fix:**

* Scan for `pickle.loads`, `marshal.loads`, Java `ObjectInputStream.readObject`, PHP `unserialize()`, and unsafe YAML loaders on untrusted input
* Replace with safe formats (strict JSON) and `yaml.safe_load()`; avoid object instantiation during parsing
* Validate incoming data against a schema (JSON Schema, Pydantic, Zod, Joi) before it's processed

**Checklist:**

* \[ \] No `pickle.loads()` with user data
* \[ \] YAML uses `safe_load()` not `load()`
* \[ \] No untrusted data passed to deserializers
* \[ \] User-supplied data validated against a schema before processing

## Advanced Hardening (Mature-Stage Layer)

A further layer of controls, worth adding once the base playbook above is covered and the product has matured past early-stage risk:

* String comparisons for secrets use constant-time checks, not regular equality
* GraphQL APIs have query depth and complexity limits
* Outbound webhooks are protected against SSRF, so they can't be tricked into hitting the internal network
* The lockfile (`package-lock.json`/`pnpm-lock.yaml`/`yarn.lock`) is checked in, so a compromised package can't sneak into a build
* The admin dashboard is IP allow-listed, not open to the whole internet
* DNS has CAA records, so only the chosen CA can issue certificates for the domain
* The domain registrar account has its own separate MFA from everything else
* Canary tokens are planted in the app to give immediate signal when someone's poking around where they shouldn't
* Session tokens are bound to a device fingerprint, not just the token itself
* The CI/CD pipeline scans for secrets before every commit gets merged

## Additional Vulnerability Classes to Audit

Beyond the detailed entries above, also check for: cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery, insecure file uploads, path traversal vulnerabilities, server-side request forgery, broken password reset flows, weak session management, vulnerable JWT secrets, overly permissive CORS, missing rate limits, exposed test or staging environments, default credentials left unchanged, webhook endpoints without signature verification, payment or subscription checks done only on the front end, IDOR and role escalation, API endpoints trusting user-controlled input, logs containing sensitive information, and exposed source maps.
